Tableau Challenge - Citi Bike Analysis

1.	Top/Bottom 10 Stations

Based on the top/bottom 10 station charts, it can be concluded that both the most preferred start and stop bike positions were at Grove St. Path. Alternatively, the least preferred start position was at Leonard Gordon Park, while the least preferred end position was at Liberty St. and Broadway.

When looking at the map, there appears to be a higher concentration of volume records for Manhattan than any other areas.
 
2.	Peak Summer Hours

When looking at the peak summer hour bar chart, it can be concluded that the most popular times for bike riding during this time period was at 8 AM (8) and 6 PM (18). This makes sense, as these times reflect when most people are not working. 

3.	Trip Distance and Duration by Age

Based on the data collected for July 2019, age and gender were observed in correlation to average trip duration, average distance, and number of bike ride records. It can be concluded that both males and females aged 25 to 34 years old make up the majority of the bike rental records. 

For average trip duration, those aged 24, 51, and 72 had the highest numbers. When looking at trip distance, those aged 72 had the highest average trip distance. 

However, when looking at which age had the highest amount of trip records, it was determined to be 51. Males overall had the highest number of trips.

4.	Bike Stats

When observing overall bike stats, there were 499 total bikes recorded, the average trip distance was 0.6262. Both female and male customers had a higher overall trip averages over subscribers, which could mean that those who are only customers for one bike trip usually ride for longer trips.
